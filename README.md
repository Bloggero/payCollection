# PayCollection

PayCollection is a system created to keep track of payments from different sources. It was originally designed to keep track of those who were supposed to pay me every 15 days or every month, so I made this system to keep all records.

We will be able to create payment orders associated with users, amounts, dates, and time. We will be able to see a "Pay" button, which will settle the debt of a payment order.

In each payment order, we will see an eye icon, which, when clicked, will allow us to view the entire payment history of the user who owns that payment order, as well as how much they owe us or have paid us.

All of this is done quickly, effectively, and in real-time, so we will avoid unnecessary platform reloading.

This system is developed in PHP, MySql, Laravel 9 and Javascript, as well as HTML5, CSS3 and AdminLte v3 template.
